# PCOS Detection

## Overview
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of PCOS based on various health and lifestyle parameters.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Collection
Data for this project was collected from [source] (e.g., health surveys, clinical data, etc.). The dataset contains the following features:
- Age
- Weight
- Height
- Menstrual Cycle Length
- Hormonal Levels (e.g., LH, FSH, Testosterone)
- Insulin Levels
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Symptoms (e.g., acne, hair growth)

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Model Development
The project employs the following machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to detect PCOS.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCOS-Detection.git
   cd PCOS-Detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the PCOS detection model, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
The program will prompt you for input parameters, and it will return a prediction indicating the likelihood of PCOS.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
